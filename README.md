# BatteryGo

System tray app written in Go to show a warning when the battery level drops below a specified level, currently set to 40%.

This was written because my laptop started shutting down when the battery got to around 30% and I wanted some warning.

The system tray and warning dialog libraries are cross-platform, but I have only tested this on Windows 10.

CGo not required.
